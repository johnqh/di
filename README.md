# @johnqh/di

Platform-agnostic dependency injection interfaces for React and React Native projects.

## Overview

This library provides abstract TypeScript interfaces for dependency injection patterns that work across web and React Native platforms. It contains no platform-specific code and focuses purely on defining contracts for common services.

## Features

- üöÄ **Platform Agnostic**: Works with both React and React Native
- üì± **React Native Compatible**: No web-specific dependencies
- üîå **Dependency Injection**: Clean interface-based architecture
- üéØ **TypeScript First**: Fully typed interfaces
- üèóÔ∏è **Modular**: Import only what you need

## Installation

```bash
npm install @johnqh/di
```

## Usage

```typescript
import {
  NetworkClient,
  StorageProvider,
  AnalyticsService,
  EnvProvider
} from '@johnqh/di';

// Implement interfaces for your specific platform
class MyNetworkClient implements NetworkClient {
  // Your implementation
}
```
